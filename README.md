# UnfoldingMapsProject

-----------
  Summary 
-----------
This interactive application helps visualize earthquake data on a world map. Recent quakes will be plotted on a map to highlight potential disaster zones. Earthquake data is read from a live RSS feed.

Although earthquake data was primarily used, this application is not limited to just this. The project will work with any other geotagged data, like airports and airplane routes.

Data is organized into features and markers.

Features is a class of objects used to store locations, quake type, magnitude, age, elevation, and title.

Markers will help to display features. A marker is a class of objects that visually represents a feature.
